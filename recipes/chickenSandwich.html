<strong><h2>Steps:</h2></strong>
<strong><h3>Chicken Method: </h3></strong>
<ol>
    <li><p>Add spices to buttermilk and mix. Then add chicken and then marinate for at least an hour and up to overnight</p></li>
    <li><p>When ready to fry, get a big pot, fill it halfway with a neutral oil, and heat to 350. Next crack an egg into the marinade and mix thoroughly. Then get your flour mixture ready. Once ready, use your hand to dip the chicken into the flour and cover thoroughly, leaving no wet spots. Place on a wire rack or plate and let rest for 10 minutes.</p></li>
    <li><p>Once the oil is 350 or slightly above place the chicken in carefully laying away from you and fry for about 6 to 10 minutes till it is golden brown and the internal temp is 165 degrees. Do not overcrowd the pot, only 1 to 3 pieces at a time!</p></li>
    <li><p>Once down place on a wire rack or a plate with paper towels to drain excess oil.</p></li>
    <li><p>Add honey and cold butter to a pan on medium heat. Whisk to combine and once combined add hot sauce and you are done with the sauce. Dunk chicken in and coat thoroughly.</p></li>
    <li><p>Add Chicken to a brioche bun with some pickles and some kimchi ranch and youâ€™re ready to go crazy</p></li>
</ol>

<strong><h3>Fries Method: </h3></strong>
<ol>
    <li><p>Put fries into air fryer or oven and cook according to package instructions</p></li>
    <li><p>Add garlic, parsley, and parmesan to a heatproof bowl</p></li>
    <li><p>Once fries are almost done warm up about 1-2 tbsp of oil into a pan and once hot dump oil into bowl with garlic and let sit for about 30 seconds</p></li>
    <li><p>Mix thoroughly till everything is combined</p></li>
    <li><p>Add fries to bowl and toss to combine. I did add some extra salt and spices like cayenne, paprika, and MSG</p></li>
